ok 100$ and as long as you gonna make new order i want a timing game bot only that support Arabic and have the option to start a game itself or just solve timing games others start in the room but the bot must be accurate time, not just randomly solve so 2 options:
1- bot type:
1
2
3
!وقت it's !timing in arabic
second option:
i start the bot it waits till someone in the room starts a game and solves it.
and ill tip an extra 50$ too so all 150$

<!-- 
also, gw autoplay need som adjustments it's always skipping the new game after a correct answer and starts a new one -->
